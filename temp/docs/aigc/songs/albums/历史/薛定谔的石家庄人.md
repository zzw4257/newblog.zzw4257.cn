[Intro]

(Harmonica solo for 4 bars. The electric guitar enters with a clean, gentle melodic fill. The full band kicks in with a simple, steady beat.)

[Verse 1]

(Male vocalist enters with a clear, slightly raspy baritone. The delivery is calm and narrative.)

傍晚六点半，擦着旧吉他

擦不掉琴身上，药厂的尘埃啊

妻子望着窗外，沉默地发着呆

她说今天的云，像被撕开了一块

我拧开啤酒，泡沫往外排

像有些话，堵着喉咙说不出来

恍惚间我听见，有人在耳边徘徊

哼着一支我既熟悉又陌生的节拍

[Chorus]

(The music builds. The electric guitar becomes more prominent with a slightly overdriven tone, and the drums become more assertive. The vocals gain intensity and emotion.)

他们说大厦没塌，只是换了新瓦

用一幅未来的图画，盖住了昨天的伤疤

他们说向前看吧，别总恋着旧伤疤

可我脚下的裂缝，还在无声地发着芽

我是那个杀不死的，还是早就死了啊？

对着两种回声，我该如何回答

[Verse 2]

(The music returns to the calmer feel of the first verse. The bass plays a subtle walking line.)

我的孩子，已长得比我高大

他刷着手机，对我的世界感到奇怪

他问我什么是，铁饭碗的悲哀

然后笑着说，那都是上个时代的尘埃

我想对他讲讲，关于父辈的年代

讲那些褪色的理想，和还不起的债

他却戴上耳机，音量开到最大

屏幕的光，映着他漠然的神态

[Instrumental Break 1]

(Harmonica takes the lead again, playing a soulful, emotional solo that mirrors the chorus melody. The acoustic guitar provides a solid rhythmic backing.)

[Bridge]

(The music becomes sparse and tense. The drums drop to a simple hi-hat pattern, and the bass holds long, low notes. The electric guitar plays quiet, atmospheric swells.)

收音机里传来，两种声音在吵架

像要把我的脑袋，给活活地撑炸

(A firm, official-sounding news anchor voice)

“我们将重塑荣光，再创神话！这是新时代的石家庄啊！”

(A tired, cynical older worker's voice)

“荣光？我的工龄谁给报销啊？神话里可没我这家啊！”

(A numb, phone-scrolling young person's voice)

“吵什么啊，发个段子比较好吧？流量才是硬通货啊！”

我捂住耳朵，却关不掉它，这裂缝已在我心里住下

[Instrumental Break 2]

(A dynamic build-up. The electric guitar plays a melodic, increasingly passionate solo. The drums add fills, and the cymbals crash, pushing the energy to a peak before smoothly transitioning back into the final chorus.)

[Chorus]

(The final chorus is delivered with maximum intensity. The vocalist sounds almost desperate. The entire band plays at full volume.)

他们说大厦没塌，只是换了新瓦

用一幅未来的图画，盖住了昨天的伤疤

他们说向前看吧，别总恋着旧伤疤

可我脚下的裂缝，还在无声地发着芽

我是那个杀不死的，还是早就死了啊？

对着两种回声，我已无法回答

[Outro]

(The music begins to fade out. The electric guitar drops out, then the bass and drums. The acoustic guitar strums slow down, becoming softer.)

(The harmonica returns one last time, playing a fragmented, questioning phrase from the intro melody.)

(The song ends on the final, lingering note of the harmonica, which hangs in the air before fading completely into silence.)
